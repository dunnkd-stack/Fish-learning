 <title>Ocean Environment</title>
<p>Pelagic Environment (Open Water): This encompasses the entire water column not in direct contact with the ocean floor or the shore. It is often called the "deserts of the sea" but is home to abundant plankton, fish, whales, and dolphins.
Benthic Environment (Ocean Floor): This environment includes the seafloor, from the high-tide mark to the deepest ocean trenches. Organisms here (like sponges, worms, and some fish) are adapted to living on or near the bottom, where temperature and light change with depth. 
ntertidal Zone: The area between the high and low tide marks that is alternately submerged in water and exposed to air. Organisms here must withstand significant variations in temperature, salinity, and wave action.
Neritic Zone: The shallow, sunlit water over the continental shelf, extending from the low-tide mark to the edge of the continental shelf. High nutrient levels from land runoff support abundant life, including coral reefs and kelp forests.
Oceanic Zone: The vast open ocean beyond the continental shelf. Waters here are typically deeper and have lower nutrient concentrations than the neritic zone. 
Epipelagic Zone (Sunlight Zone): The surface layer (down to approximately 200m) where enough sunlight penetrates for photosynthesis to occur. This is the most biodiverse zone and the source of most ocean food webs.
Mesopelagic Zone (Twilight Zone): Extends from 200m to 1,000m. Light is present but very dim, not enough for photosynthesis. Many organisms here are adapted to low light and low oxygen conditions.
Bathypelagic Zone (Midnight Zone): From 1,000m to 4,000m, this zone is completely dark, with high pressure and near-freezing temperatures.
Abyssopelagic Zone (Abyssal Zone): Extends from 4,000m to the seafloor (around 6,000m). It is characterized by immense pressure, extreme cold, and darkness.
Hadalpelagic Zone (Hadal Zone): The deepest regions of the ocean, found within deep-sea trenches (below 6,000m).
Coral Reefs: Vibrant and complex ecosystems found in shallow, warm waters, built by coral polyps. They are sometimes called the "rainforests of the sea" due to their high biodiversity.
Kelp Forests: Large underwater forests of seaweed that provide food and shelter for marine life, typically found in cooler coastal waters.
Mangrove Forests & Salt Marshes: Coastal wetlands and forests in tropical and temperate regions that serve as crucial nursery grounds for many species and help protect shorelines from erosion.
Estuaries: Areas where freshwater rivers and streams flow into the ocean, creating a mix of fresh and saltwater.
Hydrothermal Vents & Cold Seeps: Formed by volcanic activity on the seafloor, these extreme deep-sea environments support unique ecosystems reliant on chemical energy (chemosynthesis) rather than sunlight.
